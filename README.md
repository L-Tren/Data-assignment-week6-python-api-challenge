## Weather Task


### Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

![Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude](output_data/Northern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Max_Temp.png)

There is a strong negative linear relationship between the Northern Hemisphere Max Temperature (degrees celsius) and Latitude.


### Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude


![Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude](output_data/Southern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Max_Temp.png)

There is a moderate positive linear relationship between the Southern Hemisphere Max Temperature (degrees celsius) and Latitude.


### Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

![Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude](output_data/Northern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Humidity.png)

There is a weak positive linear relationship between the Northern Hemisphere Humidity (percent) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.


### Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

![Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude](output_data/Southern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Humidity.png)

There is a very weak positive linear relationship between the Southern Hemisphere Humidity (percent) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.


### Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

![Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude](output_data/Northern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Cloudiness.png)

There is a very weak positive linear relationship between the Northern Hemisphere Cloudiness (percent) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.


### Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

![Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude](output_data/Southern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Cloudiness.png)

There is a very weak positive linear relationship between the Northern Hemisphere Cloudiness (percent) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.


### Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

![Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude](output_data/Northern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Wind Speed.png)

There is a very weak negative linear relationship between the Northern Hemisphere Wind Speed (metres per second) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.

### Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

![Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude](output_data/Southern_Hemisphere_Latitude_vs._Wind_Speed.png)

There is a very weak negative linear relationship between the Southern Hemisphere Wind Speed (metres per second) and Latitude. The relationship is not meaningful.


## Vacation Task

### Map Displaying Humidity Across the Globe

![Humidity In World Cities] (output_data/HumidityInWorldCities.PNG)

### Map Displaying Hotels within a 10km radius Ideal Weather

![Humidity In World Cities] (output_data/HotelsInIdealWeatherCities.PNG)

I created a list of cities with my ideal weather parameters being:

Between 21 to 35 degrees Celsius

Below 45% humidity.

This cut down the list of cities across the globe in the first data set to a much more managable list.

Of the cities within Australia, I would choose to visit the Ibis Styles Hotel in Broken Hill.

If I were to travel overseas, I would choose to visit Bredasdorp in South Africa and stay in the Victoria Hotel.
